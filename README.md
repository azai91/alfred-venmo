##Getting started

You have to login (```v > login```) before you can use the workflow. The login uses OAuth, so you do not need to enter your credentials.

##Commands
- ```v [username] [amount] [note]```
Charges or pays a user. To pay a user insert a positive amount. The charge a user insert a **negative amount**.

- ```v > login```
Links the workflow with your Venmo amount. This option will redirect you to a Venmo Authentication page.

- ```v > logout```
Removes the current Venmo Account from the workflow.

- ```v > clear cache```
A list of friends from your Venmo are cached to increase search speed. Use this option if you want to clear the cache and make a fresh request.
